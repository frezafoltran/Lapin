{%block code_intuition%}
<p>The idea is to recursively reach the last node of the linked list, then keep
a counter while we move back to the beginning of the list, stopping when the
    desired index is achieved.</p>
{%endblock%}

{%block code_digest%}
<p><span class="step">Step 1</span> We reach the end of the list by recursively
calling a helper function with the next node. Our base case is the end of the list,
in which case, we return <span class="code">0</span>. Below,
    <span class="code">idx</span> keeps track of how far from the end of the list we are.</p>

        </div>
    </section>

<p><span class="step">Step 1</span> Since <span class="code">idx</span> is initialized to zero
    (see the <a style="cursor:pointer;" onclick="goToFullCode();">full code</a>), we increment it at each
    recursive call to keep track of how far we are from the end of linked list. When <span class="code">idx</span>
    reaches <span class="code">k</span>, we return the current node and pass it along the stack.

<p>The time complexity is O(n), where n is length of the linked list. The space complexity
